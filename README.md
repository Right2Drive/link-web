# Link Web

Acting as the web interface, Link Web is bundled using fuse-box and should be pretty straightforward to get started!

## Getting Started

Get started by installing dependencies:

`npm install` (or `yarn` if you have yarn installed)

And to run the web server use the command:

`node fuse.js`

By default this will point at `http://localhost:3030` for the core service, but in the event you need to change this simply edit `src/config/dev.js` and restart the server
